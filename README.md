# NiCo Tutorial

We are providing a tutorial on running the NiCo pipeline for the data integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (reference) and single-cell resolution of spatial transcriptomics data(query). This tutorial performs the annotations of spatial cells, predicts niche interactions, and finds co-dependent gene covariation analysis in the niche. 

First, extract the zip files and run the Juypter notebook Start_Data_preparation_for_niche_analysis.ipynb

Once it runs everything and all the normalization files are generated, then run the other Jupyter notebook Perform_spatial_analysis.ipynb
 
By default, the tutorial generates all the figures both in the respective directory and inside the notebook. Please refer to the documentation to know the details of the function's arguments.
