# NiCo Tutorial

We are providing a tutorial on running the NiCo pipeline for the data integration of single-cell RNA sequences and single-cell resolution of spatial transcriptomics data. This tutorial performs the annotations of spatial cells, predicts niche interactions, and finds co-dependent gene covariation analysis in the niche. 

First, extract the zip files. 

Run the Juypter notebook Start_Data_preparation_for_niche_analysis.ipynb
Once it runs everything and all the normalization files are generated, then run the other Jupyter notebook Perform_spatial_analysis.ipynb 
This notebook generates all the figures in the respective directory and the notebook.
